# next-absolute-url

> Get the protocol and host for the absolute URL of your Next.js app (and optionally set a dev url)

This module enables you to easily get the protocol and host of your Next.js app, both on the server and the client. Optionally, you can set a localhost variable, which is useful for local development if you have local lambda functions running on a different port.

## Usage

> I'm honored that an excellent blog post has been published about this package. For detailed usage, please see: https://web.archive.org/web/20211110110818/https://codeconqueror.com/blog/get-the-current-url-in-next-js/

```js
import absoluteUrl from 'next-absolute-url'
const { protocol, host } = absoluteUrl(req, 'localhost:8004')
const apiURL = `${protocol}//${host}/api/job.js`
```

```js
import absoluteUrl from 'next-absolute-url'
const { protocol, host } = absoluteUrl(req, '', { https: true }) // protocol will be https
const apiURL = `${protocol}//${host}/api/job.js`
```

or if you just want the full URL origin:

```js
import absoluteUrl from 'next-absolute-url'
const { origin } = absoluteUrl(req)
const apiURL = `${origin}/api/job.js`
```

If you deployed your Next.js app with `now` the `apiURL` will be something like `https://your-app.now.sh/api/job.js`.

However, if you are running the app locally the `apiURL` will be `http://localhost:8004/api/job.js` instead.

## Install
